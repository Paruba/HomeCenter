This is a test application featuring React on the frontend and .NET on the backend. In this application, users can create multiple thermometers, each assigned a unique token. Additionally, users can add cameras, which also have their own tokens. The tokens for both thermometers and cameras can be included in the request header. This setup allows devices, such as a Raspberry Pi, to send temperature data and video footage from its camera to the application. All the received data and videos are then saved to a database.
